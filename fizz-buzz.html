    // FizzBuzz: The big picture problem:
    // Write a program that takes a user’s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered.
    // However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz.
    // For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

    // Reword clearly:
    // Write a program that allows the user to enter a number,
    // print each number between one and the number the user entered,
      // but for numbers that divide by 3 without a remainder print Fizz instead.
      // For numbers that divide by 5 without a remainder print Buzz
      // and finally for numbers that divide by both 3 and 5 without a remainder print FizzBuzz.

    // Planning
    // Interface: browser console program, so we don’t need an interface,  users need to enter a number
    // Inputs: user will enter a number from a prompt (popup box)
    // Desired output: a list of numbers from 1 to the number the user entered,
      // each number that is divisible by 3 will output Fizz,
      // each number that is divisible by 5 will output Buzz
      // each number that is divisible by both 3 and 5 will output FizzBuzz

    // Pseudocode
    // When a user inputs a number
    // Loop from 1 to the entered number
    // If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
    // If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
    // If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
    // Otherwise print the current number
